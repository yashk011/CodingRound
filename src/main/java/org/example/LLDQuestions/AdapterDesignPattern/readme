1. Adapter Pattern is used when the client wants to interact with server
and expect certain format but server sends data in other format.

2. Bridges the Gap between existing interface and expected interface.

Use Case -
=========

1. XML to JSON Parser
======================

Client ---       Adapter --- Server
(accepts json)                (sends xml)


2. Weight Machine
=================

        server return weight in pound
        but client expects weight in kgs


3. Power Adapter and Normal Socket
===================================
    Adapter is required


Client --->   IAdapter
                |
                | isA
                |        hasA
              Adapter <------- Server (Actual Interface)
